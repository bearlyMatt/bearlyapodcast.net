# Teaser - Let's Talk About Stuff
## Introduction and expectations
Hello there, and welcome to Episode 0 of bearly a podcast! This is the part where I, Matthew Harazim - your host, get to jump into the darkest parts of my mind and let you know what this podcast is really all about, and what you can expect in your ears from here on out.

Bearly a podcast! is the result of a very simple problem: "An audio engineer wants to work in podcast production but doesn't have a portfolio. What should he do?" Bearly a podcast! was the answer. The more and more I toyed with the idea of a purely 'portfolio' podcast, I decided that maybe, seeing as it's a new year, and there's more home-time than usual, I should develop the idea into something more.

Each week you'll find a range of topics in the spotlight, from *trying to break into the Fiverr market*, to *CBD*, and *analouge wellbeing* to *retro gaming*. Sometimes, there'll be special arcs, such as RPG one-shots and solo RPG adventures. If I'm lucky, I might even be able to find a guest to talk to me and teach me things -> I'm looking at you *CBD*. If, like me, you've been living under a rock for almost a year, you might find some answers to those weird questions you've been asking.

## Credibility
I guess that wraps up the intro to the podcast; so what about me? I'm your host, Matthew Harazim, a recent graduate with lots of theoretical knowledge and a grand total of almost no experience in the professional audio industry. What can I say? Universities are great if they can guarantee you a job after you're done. 

I'm based out of Edinburgh in Scotland and currently work in the Retail Sector (that is, until I catch my big break). I've studied Music at the University of Aberdeen, and Sound Design at the University of Edinburgh and used all that knowledge to start up my own post-production studio *bearSound Studio* trying to help out digital content creators get the best sound they can, because local/indie businesses are one of a kind, and worth supporting.

Thanks for listening, and see you early February for episode 1.
