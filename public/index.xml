      <description>bearly a podcast! is a audio blog/podcast about Matt, a 25 y/o wannabe sound engineer, with lots of knowledge and no experience. Each week, Matt tackles a new and exciting topic; sometimes trying to learn things, sometimes trying to teach. If you like nerdy things, pop culture and seeing if one man can crack the audio industry then this podcast is for you! In this pseudo episode, Matt talks about the inspiration behind the podcast, and what you can expect in the future!</description>

      <description>Matt is an unemployed audio creative (sound design and audio engineering) but an employed retail worker. Most of his time is crammed with retail work, but in his free time, Matt is an avid TTRPG gamer currently playing D&amp;amp;D 5e with Roll For Mischief; GM Blades in the Dark and Symbaroum; hoping to GM Heart the City Beneath. Other than gaming, Matt lives for coffee, and happily reads his way through sci-fi and fantasy books, whilst trying to teach two cats to love him.</description>
